# Poke-App (Develop)

The PoKemon web and mobile app that allows you to check information of a certain pokemon using React, React Native and the PokeAPI

<br>

## Future Features

At the moment several changes are being made to this project but the main features already proposed are as they follow:
  *  Search by pokemon type (and pokemon name).
  *  Search ability by name and obtain results.
  *  Search move by name and show the results.
  *  List panels of search result for each one of the previous results.

  Feel free to make your own suggestion.
  In the next [segment](#currentwork) you will find out how you can do just that.

## Current Work
To check the current work of this project you can head to the [Issues Panel](https://github.com/DavidFFDAW/Poke-App/issues) on the GitHub repository where you can check the stuff that is being worked on as of that moment or you can add new issues if you discover a bug or want a new feature that you believe it could be great to implement.

Take into account that as of right now there's only one person creating this whole thing and mantaining it so don't be crazy with your suggestions or don't expect them to be solved fast.
